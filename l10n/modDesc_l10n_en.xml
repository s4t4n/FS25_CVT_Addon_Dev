		<text name="help_page_HST_text" text="If a vehicle is configured as HST, there are two hydraulic drive types that can be changed through the former driving ranges 1 and 2. Here you should decide which type of vehicle has - in reality a vehicle cannot have both." />
		<text name="help_page_HST1_text" text="1 is the classic HST, where the foot pedal is usually designed like a rocker or there are two pedals on the left and right, each for backwards and forwards. If you press the pedal for one direction of travel, the vehicle moves as a percentage of the pedal - but the engine speed remains unchanged (idle). This means that the maximum speed is not reached. The hand throttle must be used for this. At 100% hand throttle, the travel speed can still be operated as a percentage because it is a hydraulic drive. Furthermore, the performance of the front loader on wheel loaders depends on the hand throttle, i.e. the lower the engine speed - which is also the pump speed - the slower the hydraulic lifting cylinders move. In addition, the heavier a front loader tool is and the heavier it is loaded, the lower the hand throttle is set, the lower the speed when lifting it. Be careful, if the engine is still cold and you operate the front loader, the engine can stall." />
		<text name="help_page_HST2_text" text="2 is the newer version, which offers many, many other variations depending on the manufacturer - but I won't go into all of them. In addition to a brake, there is usually only one accelerator pedal instead of two. There is also a joystick or something similar with which you can set forwards, backwards and neutral if necessary. If you press the accelerator pedal, the engine speed regulates automatically and the vehicle accelerates to the percentage of the pedal being pressed. Furthermore, the engine speed increases automatically as soon as the front loader is operated - as long as the accelerator pedal is pressed at least 0.001%. At 0% pedal position, the hand throttle must still be used to ensure a minimum speed. In reality it's a little different, but unfortunately it can't be implemented quite like that in the game mechanics." />
		<text name="help_page_HST3_text" text="Drive features: Either there are hydraulic motors directly on/behind the wheels or there is an HST transmission, which usually also takes over the AWD supply with a cardan shaft (if AWD is available). The latter is more of a newer variant. Older generation AWDs, especially articulated vehicles, use a hydraulic transmission at the front and rear. The stepless acceleration ramps have a slightly different function on HST's! The HUD then says 'HySt' - but it can still be switched from 1 to 4. These are the speed ranges for hydrostatic drives: 4 fastest, 1 fast, 2 slow, 3 slowest " />
		<text name="help_page_HARVESTER_text" text="This configuration is the right choice for most modern threshers and shredders. Everything is very similar to the HST configuration, but there is a field mode and a road driving area - driving areas 1 and 2 represent this. In field mode it is also possible to use a corresponding input device, e.g. a joystick that does not center or a throttle with center, as a drive lever. In addition, the vehicles can simply be started in this configuration. But be careful if the hand throttle is still turned on and the engine is not yet warm.
